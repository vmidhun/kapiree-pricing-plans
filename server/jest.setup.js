// server/jest.setup.js
// This file is intentionally left minimal.
// Database connections are mocked within individual test files (e.g., server/__tests__/auth.test.js)
// to ensure tests are isolated, fast, and do not depend on a running database instance.

// You can add other global setup/teardown logic here if needed,
// but avoid real database connections or other external dependencies.
